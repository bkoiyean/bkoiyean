### I love Mathâ€™s, Logic & Algorithm. 

- ðŸŒ± I am a mathematically gifted student & top scorer in Vietnam University entrance exam: 10/10 Mathâ€™s. It helps me a lot in enjoying my favourite games as well as performing my work.

- ðŸ˜„ I can solve Rubikâ€™s Cube by myself and solve Fibonacci Sequence with time complexity: O (log n) with my own formula.

- âš¡ In addition to can-do attitude, I learnt Python by myself to build an Auto Payment Approval software that can replace many staff to get the job done.

- âš¡ An online backend course brought me a more obvious picture about IT Developer. I then also created my first Web App: a completed E-commerce FX trading website.

- ðŸ¤” I am passionate about IT but working in business. So I'm looking for a right place to boost my IT career.
