### I love Mathâ€™s, Logic & Algorithm. 

- ðŸŒ± I am a mathematically gifted student & top scorer in Vietnam University entrance exam: 10/10 Mathâ€™s. It helps me a lot in enjoying my favourite games as well as performing my work.

- ðŸ˜„ I can solve Rubikâ€™s Cube by myself and solve Fibonacci Sequence with time complexity: O (log n) with my own formula.

- âš¡ With can-do attitude, I taught myself Python to build an Auto Payment Approval software that can replace many staff to get the job done.

- âš¡ An online backend course brought me a more obvious picture about IT. I then also created my first Web App: a completed E-commerce FX trading website.

- ðŸ¤” With a passion for IT, strong background in business and interest of helping people, I hope I can find a right place to utilise my skills in the best possible way not only to fulfil my career but also to benefit the community.
